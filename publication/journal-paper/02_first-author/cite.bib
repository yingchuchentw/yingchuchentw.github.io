              Recent studies indicate that acute exercise, whether aerobic exercise (AE) or resistance exercise (RE), improves cognitive function. However, the effects on cognitive function of combined exercise (CE), involving both AE and RE in an exercise session, remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acute CE on cognitive function.
            
            
              Design
              Within-subject design with counterbalancing.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Fifteen healthy men with a sedentary lifestyle in the previous three months were recruited. The participants were assessed for muscular fitness after performing four upper body exercises for a 10-repetition maximum and underwent a submaximal aerobic fitness assessment for V̇O

                and corresponding workload (watts). They were then assigned to a CE, RE, or sitting control (SC) session in counterbalanced order and were assessed with the Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) after each session.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Acute CE led to a significantly shorter response time compared to SC (
                p
                 < .05) in the SCWT, wherein there were no significant differences between acute CE and RE (
                p
                 = 1.00). Additionally, no significant differences in the accuracy rate were observed across the different sessions (
                ps
                 > .05).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              A single session of moderate-intensity CE improved response time in the SCWT, comparable to RE. CE shows promise for enhancing cognitive function, warranting further research on its benefits and other exercise modalities.}, journal={PeerJ}, author={Chen, Ying-Chu and Li, Ruei-Hong and Chen, Feng-Tzu and Wu, Chih-Han and Chen, Chung-Yu and Chang, Che-Chien and Chang, Yu-Kai}, year={2023}, month={Aug}, pages={e15768}, language={en} }
