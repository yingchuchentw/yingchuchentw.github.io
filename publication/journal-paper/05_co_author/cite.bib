  abstract  = "Purpose Cognitive function, particularly food-related cognition,
               is critical for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing the
               acceleration of obesity. High-Intensity Interval Exercise (HIIE)
               is an increasingly popular form of exercise and has been shown
               to improve physical fitness and cognitive function. However,
               there is limited research on the effects and underlying
               mechanisms of HIIE on general and food-related cognition among
               adults with obesity. The aim of the current study was to examine
               the influence of a single bout of HIIE on food-related cognition
               among young adults with obesity. Methods Fifteen young men with
               obesity (BMI = 33.88 $\pm$ 4.22, age = 24.60 $\pm$ 5.29 years)
               were recruited. Participants took part in a HIIE condition
               consisting of 30 minutes of stationary cycle exercise (5-min
               warm-up, 20-min HIIE and 5-min cool down), and a control session
               consisting of a time and attention-matched period of sedentary
               rest in a counterbalanced order. Behavioral (reaction time and
               accuracy) and event-related potential measures (P3 and the late
               positive potential, LPP) elicited during a food-related Flanker
               task were measured after the HIIE and control session. Results
               Shorter response times were observed following HIIE, regardless
               of congruency or picture type, with no change in accuracy.
               Increased P3 and LPP amplitudes were observed following HIIE
               relative to the control session. Conclusion The findings suggest
               a single bout of HIIE has a beneficial effect on general and
               food-related cognition among young adults with obesity, with
               increased recruitment of cognitive resources to support
               cognitive control. Future research is warranted to examine the
               dose-response relationship between acute bouts or longer
               participation in HIIE on food-related cognition in obesity.",
