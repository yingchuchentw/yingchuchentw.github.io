              combined exercise modalities on executive function in healthy
              adults and observed the associations of potential biomarkers
              (i.e., brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF; human growth
              hormone, HGH; insulin-like growth factor-1, IGF-1; and cortisol)
              on cognitive performance. METHODS: Twelve young healthy male
              adults were recruited and assigned to the following three
              experimental interventions in a randomized crossover manner:
              sitting control (SC), resistance exercise plus continuous aerobic
              exercise (RA) and resistance exercise plus intermittent aerobic
              exercise (RI). Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) and blood
              collection were conducted before and immediately after each
              intervention. RESULTS: The results showed that both acute
              combined exercise trials significantly reduced SCWT-incongruent
              response time compared to the SC trial (RA: p = .015, RI: p =
              .014). The serum BDNF and HGH levels were significantly increased
              in both RA (BDNF: p < .0001, HGH: p = .004) and RI (BDNF: p =
              .013, HGH: p = .007) trials, and the serum IGF-1 level was
              significantly increased in the RI trial (p = .008). The changes
              in SCWT-incongruent response time were significantly associated
              with the changes in blood lactate (r = - 0.622, p < .0001) and
              RPE (r = - 0.364, p = .029) following the interventions.
              CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate the beneficial effects of two
              different combined exercise modalities on executive function in
              these young healthy males that could be related to an increase in
              brain energy supply and arousal status. IRB REGISTRATION NUMBER:
