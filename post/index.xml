      <title>單次同步運動對於認知執行功能之影響</title>
      <link>https://yingchuchentw.github.io/post/2023_08_21_peerj_publication/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 09:00:00 +0800</pubDate>
      <guid>https://yingchuchentw.github.io/post/2023_08_21_peerj_publication/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;認知執行功能在日常生活當中扮演相當重要的角色，認知執行功能是指一系列高階心理過程，包括注意力控制、工作記憶、認知靈活性、問題解決能力以及抑制控制等。這些功能協助我們處理複雜的資訊、適應環境變化以及有效地規劃和執行任務。在日常生活中，認知執行功能扮演著關鍵的角色，影響著我們的學習、工作、人際關係和整體生活品質。像是：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. 工作和學習：在職場和學習環境中，我們需要處理大量資訊、優先安排任務、集中注意力，並持續保持高度的認知靈活性。良好的認知執行功能有助於提升工作效率和學習成果。工作記憶的強大意味著我們能夠暫時儲存並處理信息，這對於解決複雜的問題和執行多步驟任務至關重要。

2. 人際關係：與他人互動需要我們不僅理解對方的情感和意圖，還需要適當地表達自己的觀點。認知執行功能可以幫助我們保持專注，避免分心，並在溝通中選擇合適的言語和行為反應。同時，它還有助於我們理解和掌握社交規則，從而建立良好的人際關係。

3. 自我管理與情緒調控：良好的認知執行功能有助於我們抵制衝動，從而更好地管理情緒和行為。在面對壓力和挑戰時，我們可以利用這些功能來冷靜思考、制定解決方案，而不是受情緒支配。這種情緒調控有助於維護心理健康，減少情緒爆發和衝突。

4. 日常生活技能：從買菜做飯到交通導航，我們的日常生活充滿了需要認知執行功能的活動。注意力控制有助於我們專注於重要任務，不受干擾。抑制能力使我們能夠避免不必要的行為或說話。認知靈活性則允許我們適應不同的環境和情境。

5. 老年健康：隨著年齡的增長，認知執行功能的衰退可能會影響老年人的生活。保持這些功能的良好狀態有助於延緩認知衰退的速度，並提高老年人的生活質量。訓練和鍛煉這些功能可以幫助保持大腦的靈活性和活力。
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;總而言之，認知執行功能是我們在面對複雜任務、挑戰和日常生活中所需的關鍵心理能力。它們影響著我們的思考方式、情緒管理、人際關係以及生活品質。這篇研究發現: 單次同步運動可以提升成年男性訊息處理速度，但是在抑制控制則與阻力運動無顯著差異，對於其它族群之影響，目前則尚待更多研究釐清！&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;疫情期間，許多人由於政府政策以及居家隔離等因素，進而必須暫停或者中斷健身運動，或者是想藉由身體活動以及健身運動來增加自身的免疫力。那麼，該如何透過簡單居家運動來達到這樣的效果呢？國立臺北護理健康大學運動保健學系廖翊宏教授兼任系主任認為規律進行有氧耐力運動訓練者，其呼吸肌功能將會相較於沒有進行規律訓練者要來得較好！並且人們可以透過簡單的居家訓練動作，無論是肌力訓練或者是有氧耐力訓練，來達到健身運動訓練效果。此外，也可以透過虛擬實境運動軟體或者是線上課程教學，來達到增加社會互動以及促進更好的訓練效果。讓我們參考這篇報導！連結在此喔：https://youtu.be/G9ScfKCTNak &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How can exercise science professionals develop better tactical strength and conditioning program for the tactical athletes? It may not be easy to achieve in short period of time instead of going through the mill. With the promotion of government and exercise science professionals, it will definitely lead to great success!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The most outstanding self-learning community</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 14:30:20 +0800</pubDate>
      <guid>https://yingchuchentw.github.io/post/2022_01_11/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we accept the most outstanding self-learning community award in university of Taipei with profound gratitude. In addition, we can&amp;rsquo;t describe how honored we are to receive this award!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most import of all, we will accept the prize as a tribute to &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Yu-Kai Chang&lt;/strong&gt; (Research Chair Professor, Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences, National Taiwan Normal University), &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Ching-Feng Cheng&lt;/strong&gt; (Professor, Department of Athletic Performance, National Taiwan Normal University), &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Yi-Hung Liao&lt;/strong&gt;  (Professor, Department of Exercise and Health Science, National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences), and &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Hsin-Fu Lin&lt;/strong&gt; (Professor, Sport Facility Management and Health Promotion, National Taiwan University). Thank you all for novel and marvelous speech!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this award is being given to me, as a matter of fact, it should go to our team of colleagues and PI, &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Chung-Yu Chen&lt;/strong&gt; (Professor &amp;amp; Director of R&amp;amp;D office, Department of Exercise and Health Sciences, University of Taipei), without whom none of this would have been possible! Let&amp;rsquo;s keep moving forward with strong and active faith in exercise science, sport science, and health science!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role</title>
      <link>https://yingchuchentw.github.io/post/2021_12_29/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 18:11:20 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a practitioner in exercise science, &lt;strong&gt;mindset&lt;/strong&gt; is very important! We are not only the &lt;strong&gt;experiment conductor&lt;/strong&gt; but also the &lt;strong&gt;participant&lt;/strong&gt; sometimes instead. Both roles all lead to the the central role of exercise science. How we balance these two role might be the issue for featured research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As professor Liao always reminds us that: “Something very small or minor can be indicative of something much more important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, an experiment is not just an experiment, it’s about how well  you organize and prepare for the oncoming difficulty and possible defeat. Life isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, how much we can take the challenge and keep moving forward would be the key!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Academic Plan in Doctoral Degree</title>
      <link>https://yingchuchentw.github.io/post/academic_plan/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 12:05:52 +0800</pubDate>
      <guid>https://yingchuchentw.github.io/post/academic_plan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To be updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My future academic plan in doctoral degree will be described in this post. I will explain my future career as the following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academic Performance&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
2. &lt;strong&gt;Fitness Industry Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of Doctoral Training might be research, but NOT only for research itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the main aim of doctoral training is to help PhD researchers to think and act more creatively and independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will prepare them for a career in frontier research and education or for higher level roles in professional sectors where in-depth and rigorous analysis is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve this aim, the doctoral training should focus on personal development in 4 complementary areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional expertise
a.Knowledge of the exercise science and health science discipline
b.Analytic and synthesizing skills
c.creativity thinking
d.out-of-the-box thinking (critical thinking)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research management skills
a.Project management and financing sponsorship consideration
b.respecting professional and ethical standards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal effectiveness
a.Self-management (Self-disciplined)
b.time management
c.motivation
d.problem solving
e.career planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact and influence
a.Collaboration communication
b.networking
c.leadership&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research-based training &amp;amp; structured training activities by the Doctoral School&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, Doctoral training takes place first and foremost in the research group or laboratory via informal and formal meetings with the supervisor and fellow researchers. This research-based training is complemented by more structured training activities organized by the Doctoral School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structured part of the doctoral training consists of 3 components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thematic training in a doctoral school programs comprising advanced courses, invited lectures, journal clubs and doctoral seminars focused on a specific biomedical topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training and development of transferable skills that are relevant for the successful completion of the doctorate and can be valorised later in different professional sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
